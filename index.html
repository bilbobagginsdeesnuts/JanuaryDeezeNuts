        <p>My mum was dog sitting two other dogs after ruby and the cat, these dogs are a
                        fucking handful - one has anxiety and will just start licking you and will not stop. While i was
                        there a
                        thunderstorm rolled through so my mum rushed to drug the one with anxiety but the other one took
                        it so they
                        were both high as fuck just wanting human contact while they were sprayed out on the

                                this,
                                someone in the 80s finally gets to make lotr into a movie! The first movie? Its pretty
                                good, faithful in
                                ways and rushed in others by they only gave it 90 mins. Then the movie releases and
                                honestly, its not
                                the biggest hit. But they get a sequel! But the studio don&#39;t want to do a trilogy so
                                they squish the
                                2nd and 3rd books into one movie. That is what this musical is, but with some of the
                                most boring songs
                                imaginable. Besides the bilbo and sam song sitting at the base of mount doom the rest
                                are just choir
                                songs and aragon longing for his elf lady friend who i didnt know was in the books

        <p>Ok so im currently making the slideshow for my grandfathers funeral, and im still
                        yet
                        to cry making it but i reckon ill do that on the day but also im now like &ldquo;oh i am gonna
                        do black
                        nails for the funeral&rdquo; which i feel is good goth shit but im also like, fuck my aunt is
                        incredibly
                        homophobic (by the account of her own kids) but also - my mum has been on the verge of being
                        done with her
                        for about 2 years now so like, who gives a shit if she calls me a slur (i don&#39;t think she
                        would but i
                        could see her doing it behind my back) i have dealt with my grief (she never did and just
                        shifted the blame
                        on her siblings)</p>
        <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></p>
        <p>Also I had to rush out last night (I&#39;m writing this the day before the
                        funeral)
                        and get a black tie so went into my local tarocash at Marrickville metro, and the guy was so
                        scared when he
                        saw me and then said &ldquo;ah so what&#39;s this for&rdquo; and when I said funeral he shifted
                        so visibly
                        it is so fuckin funny, he was clearly so uncomfortable with it and then asked &ldquo;oh so you
                        don&#39;t
                        have to but would you donate anything to make a wish. Were falling behind on our targets&rdquo;
                        which made
                        me think why the fuck does a store have donation targets?</p>
        <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></p>
        <p>Ok it&#39;s now the Friday, and the church was much more tolerable this time,
                        last
                        time it was so fuckin preachy but we all liked this. But I went into the wake and then had to
                        run home to
                        get a cable to plug my iPad into the tv and came back to find everyone already settled and my
                        mum&#39;s
                        friend that I can&#39;t stand came (she didn&#39;t know she was coming until this morning) so I
                        sorta just
                        sat there sad for 5 mins and then decided to just walk away. I went into my grandparents old
                        shop, which I
                        haven&#39;t been in since they retired and fuck it&#39;s so different- the old bit that used to
                        be storage
                        out back is now a cafe and they&#39;ve got a butchers thing. Really just wierd. Right now
                        I&#39;m sitting
                        alone in the breaseway just trying to not anything. Don&#39;t know what that means but I&#39;ve
                        said it and
                        I feel it represents what I&#39;m at.</p>
        <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></p>
        <p>The family ended up coming back to the house and this was much better, I just
                        truly
                        could not deal with all the extended friends and old people. But we&#39;ve just done a shot of
                        an whisky
                        liquore as a toast and it was so fuckin nice, turns out it&#39;s been discontinued and
                        everyone&#39;s saving
                        their bottles for their own funerals and the fact we drunk the last of my grandfather&#39;s one
                        had a real
                        moment of &ldquo;oh shit he gone&rdquo; which I don&#39;t think had hit me before </p>
        <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></p>

        <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></p>
        <p>We did a shot of this, and i thought it was a shot and took my uncles
                        &ldquo;savour
                        it&rdquo; as a joke. Until he explained that it was a whisky you can no longer get, my
                        grandfather bought an
                        case of them from the last pallet ever sent to Aus and there was enough left for us to all have
                        a shot of it
                        and when we cheeresed i had a real fucking like &ldquo;oh this is it&rdquo; moment, and im
                        annoyed at myself
                        for downing it in one but HE DIDNT TELL ME IT WAS SPECIAL! Also i was driving home so it was
                        just a nip, but
                        it was such a nice nip and hearing everyone else go &ldquo;yeah the bottle i have will be opened
                        at my
                        funeral&rdquo; has me real sad and i had to walk away to not burst out in tears anyway. </span>
